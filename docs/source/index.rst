neuroboom Documentation
=======================

Welcome to **neuroboom**!

Neuroboom is a suite of Python3 tools for analysing neuron reconstructions within Connectomic initiatives.

Neuroboom is currently designed to operate on neuron recontructions within the CATMAID or Neuprint platforms.

These two different platforms reflect the two available connectomic efforts in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster:

1. the Full Adult Female Brain (FAFB) Zheng et al., 2018, Cell
2. the Hemibrain, Xu et al., 2020, biorXiv


Some code incorporated within the neuroboom package has been presented in published scientific papers, most notably the **dendrogram** functions:

1. `Integration of Parallel Opposing Memories Underlies Memory Extinction <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418310377?via%3Dihub>`_, J. Felsenberg et al., 2018, *Cell*
2. `Distinct subpopulations of mechanosensory chordotonal organ neurons elicit grooming of the fruit fly antennae <https://elifesciences.org/articles/59976>`_, S. Hampel et al., 2020, *eLife*
