neuroboom Documentation
=======================

Welcome to neuroboom!

Neuroboom (or *nb*) is a suite of Python3 tools for analysing neuron reconstructions within Connectomic initiatives.

NB is currently designed to operate on neuron recontructions within the CATMAID or Neuprint platforms.

These two different platforms reflect the two available connectomic efforts in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster:

1. the Full Adult Female Brain (FAFB) Zheng et al., 2018, Cell
2. the Hemibrain, Xu et al., 2020, biorXiv
